# A Game of Tic-Tac-Toe using React.js

## Why I built it this way

- This was a quick rewrite of the [React Tic-tac-toe tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) using Functional components and useState/useEffect hooks.
- I wanted to work more with React.js while also wanting to spend most of my time working with functional components instead of the older class components

## Technology used

- Create React App

## Lessons learned/ problems encountered

- Project went smoothly except that I forgot the spread operator only made shallow copies. The state mutation caused by that error took a while to troubleshoot.

## Installation

## Available scripts

```bash
npm run build
```
